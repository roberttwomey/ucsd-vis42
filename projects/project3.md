# Project 3: Free Choice / Take Something Further

## Description

This is an open choice project with a quick turnaround. 

You will need to revisit a topic or activity of your choice from this quarter, and take it a bit further. This could mean completing one more iteration or refinement of a project you liked. It could mean taking something we did as an exercise and turning it into more of a completed project. It could mean following up on something (printing with flexible filament, for instance) that we didn't talk about in class. 

This is really just a chance to push something a bit further, or complete an unfinished/under-realized piece.

## Proposal

You will submit a one paragraph proposal with your idea.

- Concept (1 paragraph)
  - What project, exercise, or idea will you revisit? 
  - What new work will you do to extend your idea? 
  - What will you fabricate/produce? 
  - What challenges do you expect you will face? (technical, conceptual, logistical)

Please include any sketches or images that help illustrate your idea. 

This written description will be [submitted online to Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/877024) by Tuesday, November 26, 2024 End of Day.
