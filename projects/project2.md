# Project 2: Hybrid Object
## Description

For this project you will make an object that is a combination of two (or more) things at once. It should be a combination of a physical and a digital object. You can think of this as a prosthesis –– scanning a real object and modeling/fabricating a prosthesis that attaches to it. You can think of it as an augmentation or exoskeleton –– a fabricated structure that provides a home for and extends the object's capabilities. This could be a site specific intervention, scanning a crack in a wall or negative space of an object and creating an object that fills it. See the [references](#references) below for some examples. The concept is open-ended, but you will need to submit a written proposal for your project. (see [proposal](#proposal) below)

For this project you will use the 3d design and fabrication techniques that we have covered in class so far, as appropriate to your concept:
- 3d modeling (Rhino, as well any other software you have experience with)
- 3d scanning (with ipad/iphone)
- laser cutting
- 3d printing

We will critique these projects in two weeks, Week 9 Tuesday.

## Proposal

You will submit a two paragraph proposal for your idea addressing the following questions below. The first paragraph should describe how you are choosing to approach the hybrid object prompt and get us excited for the concept. The second paragraph will address the logistics of your project and how you will produce and document the result.

- Concept (1 paragraph)
  - Describe your approach to the prompt. What is your object a hybrid between? 
  - Are you using real objects? Fictional objects? 
  - Is narrative an important element of your piece?
  - How will you present your object / document it?

- Process (1 paragraph)
  - How will you produce your 3d models—capturing real objects (3d scanning), 3d modeling, other approaches? Describe how these approaches serve your concept.
  - Which fabrication techniques from class will you use?
  - What materials will you fabricate your object from? What (if any) surface treatments will you use? What non-digital material/craft processes will you use?
  - How will you document your project? Consider where you will photograph the resulting object. What supporting images will you use to tell the story of your piece? Where will you document your object?

Please include any sketches or images that help illustrate your idea. 

This written description will be [submitted online to Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/856578) by Friday, November 15, 2024 End of Day.

## Deliverables

1. Proposal: 
   - Written proposal submitted to Canvas. 
2. Project 2 Submission:  
   - Add the following to your digital sketchbook and submit:
     - Written Project Description (update your written proposal once you are done with the project, this is your project description)
     - Documentation of 3d modeling (rhino captures)
     - Documentation of final object (photographs)
     - submit as a PDF to Canvas
   - Upload Rhino Models (.3dm) to Canvas
   - Upload Printable file (.stl) to Canvas
3. Critique: 
   - Present both your Object and your documentation for Critique in two weeks. (11/26)

Canvas submission DUE Tuesday 11/26 End of Day (11:59) [https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/856577](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/856577)

  - A real object, and a fabricated prosthetic for the object
