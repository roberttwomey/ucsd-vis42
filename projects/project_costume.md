## Description

For this project you will make all or a significant portion of your (or somebody else's) Halloween costume. A prop of significant size or effort would also be acceptable. The concept is open-ended, but you will need to submit a written proposal for your project. (see [proposal](#proposal) below)

For this project you should use as many of the 3d design and fabrication techniques that we have covered in class so far, as appropriate to your concept:
- 3d modeling (Rhino, as well any other software you have experience with)
- 3d scanning (with ipad/iphone)
- laser cutting
- ShopBot
- 3d printing
- vacuu-forming
- inflatables/sewing

We will critique these projects on 10/30/2023 (**the day before Halloween!**)

## Proposal

You will submit a two paragraph proposal for your idea addressing the following questions below. The first paragraph should describe how you are choosing to approach the costume or prop prompt and get us excited for the concept. The second paragraph will address the logistics of your project and how you will produce and document the result.

- Concept (1 paragraph)
  - Describe your approach to the prompt. What is your project? 
  - Is narrative an important element of your piece?
  - How will you present your object / document it?

- Process (1 paragraph)
  - How will you produce your 3d modelsâ€”capturing real objects (3d scanning), 3d modeling, other approaches? Describe how these approaches serve your concept.
  - Which fabrication techniques from class will you use?
  - What materials will you fabricate your object from? What (if any) surface treatments will you use? What non-digital material/craft processes will you use?
  - How will you document your project? Consider where you will photograph the resulting object? What supporting images wil Where will you document your object?

This written description will be [submitted online to Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/158902/assignments/1521883) by Thursday, October 18, 2023 at 15:00.
