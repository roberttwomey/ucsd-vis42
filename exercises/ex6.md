# Exercise 6: Digital Double / Virtual Replica

For this exercise, you will create a digital double of an object. You will do this in a two step process: first we will make a series of measurements and reference drawings to record all of the essential dimensions of the object. Secondly we will use those drawings as a reference while we make a 3D model in Rhino. Give some consideration to what object you would like to replicate. We will use this in Week 4/5 with the 3d printer, so choose something smallish (the size of an orange), or something that would be interesting to print at that scale. 
<br>

There are many other ways to get an object into Rhino / into the computer (for instance 3D scanning, photogrammetry), we are using drawing and 3D modeling as a means to get experience with Rihno for 3D fabrication.

# Process
1. **Choose your Object** Identify an you want to replicate. Choose something from your immediate surroundings that you have access too.
   - Some considerations: 
     - Choose something smallish (the size of an orange), or something that would be interesting to print at that scale.
     - Choose something with a regular geometric structure, or something that you can build from a combination of geometric elements. Our drawing tools are best at drawing geometry (Boxes, Spheres, etc.)
     - Thank about something you would like to have as a tiny digital replica. (thoughts?) 
     - Imagine staging a photograph of your digital replica (3d printed) next to the real object. What would make for a most interesting pairing?
2. **Dimensioned Drawing by Hand**: (pen and paper) 
   - Make a number of hand-drawn technical drawings to record the dimensions of the object
   - Use the calipers to get precise measurements. 
   - Draw a number of views of the object (Side, Top, Front, Perspective) and label dimensions on those drawings. 
     - for instance, if modeling a water bottle, you might label the total height of the bottle, and the thickness of the cap in a Side view.
   - use __Detail__ views where necessary to notate dimensions of small... _details_.
3. **Dimensionally Accurate 3d Model**: 
   - model your object in Rhino accurately, to scale.
   - use the commands we practiced in class together.
   - try organizing sketches on one layer and solids on another.
4. **Fabricate**: Export your model as an STL file and 3D print your double.

# Submission
1. Prepare your materials:
   - photographs of objects
   - photographs of sketches
   - screencaps/images of 3d model
2. Add these images to your digital sketchbook. (photos, sketches, and snapshot of your STL file)
3. Upload your files to Canvas: (use the naming convention _ex6_Lastname_1.jpg_, _ex6_Lastname.stl_, _ex6_lastname.3dm_ for the files.)
   - photographs of sketches
   - screencaps/images of 3d model
   - photographs of your 3d printed object next to your original object.
   - 3dm file and STL file

DUE 11/7, 11:59pm (Thursday) to Canvas [https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/856570](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/856570)
