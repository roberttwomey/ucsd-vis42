**Venus of Willendorf** (25000bce) [stl file](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-venus-of-willendorf-at-the-naturhistorisches-museum-vienna-austria-11455) from Scan the World on myminifactory

# Description + Process
You are going to combine a 3d scanned object with a base and text to make a small trophy (< 3" x 3" x 3"). Try to come up with some interesting combination between text, object, and base.

1. Find a 3d model you want to work with. See references below. It does not have to be a historical artifact.
2. Import your scanned object into Rhino.
3. Create an extruded base
4. Add Text. 
5. Slice this model for the Ultimaker or Prusa MK3S+, PLA filament.
6. Finally you will 3d print this model. 

# Submission
1. Take documentation:
   - Screenshots of your 3d model
   - Screenshots of your sliced model
   - Photographs of your print 
2. Add this documentation to your digital sketchbook. 
3. Submit: 
   - your rhino file
   - your STL file
   - a pdf of these pages from the digital sketchbook
