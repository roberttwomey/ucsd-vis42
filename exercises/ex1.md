<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1598545/189884689-a2ca1e56-3e37-41f0-86d4-5501d9b19a31.png">

# Description

Use the 2D drawing commands in Rhinoceros (lines, curves, etc.), design a stencil that fits on a 3x5" business card. We will cut these out using the laser cutter next week, and you can use them as actual stencils to label _your stuff_.

# Requirements
- Inclue your name and some text. 
- Develop a personal logo or some graphics. 
- Include an outline (approximately 3 x 5")
- Use **red** lines for anywhere you want the laser to cut. 
- Use **blue** lines for anywhere you want it to etch.

# Template
Rhino example: [lines_curves.3dm](../examples/lines_curves.3dm)


# Submission
- Export your image as an SVG. 
- Submit your Rhino file and SVG file to Canvas
  - use the naming convention _ex1_Lastname.svg_ and _ex1_Lastname.3dm_ for the files.
- DUE by 9:30am, 10/1 (Tuesday) to Canvas [https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/856563](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/856563)
