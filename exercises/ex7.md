# Exercise 7: Scan Big Print Small

# Description

Using your phone with Scaniverse or one of the scanners in Envision, digitize a real world object. Think big: the rear camera LIDAR is best body to room scale. Photogrammetry is ok for a range of sizes. Here we will play with scale.

# Process

1. Scan something big
2. Share the mesh with yourself (email, upload to scaniverse/sketchfab, or some other means to get it off of the device)
3. Clean up the mesh in Rhino. 
4. Print it at (small) scale (< 3x3x3")

# Submission

1. Document the scan with screenshots in Rhino.
2. Document the printed object with photographs. 
3. Add these materials to your digital sketchbook. 
4. Upload: 
   - the new pages as a pdf
   - Your Rhino file (_ex7_Lastname.3dm_).
