# Exercise 2: 3D Tab and Slot Design

# Description

Using the 2D drawing commands from week 2 (line, offset, trim, join, extrude etc.), design a 2d structure to be assembled out of cardboard. You will then cut this out on the laser cutter and present it next week.

# Design Requirements
- Use 3 or more flat parts to make a 3d shape. 
- Try not to be strictly utilitarian. If you are making a box pay some attention to surface decoration, perforation pattern, etc. 
- See what the laser cutter can do!

# Fabricate
- (If you haven't, complete the Envision responsibility contract and laser cutter training)
- Cut your design out of corrugated cardboard. (You can find this anywhere!)
  - You will need to determine good settings for cardboard. 
- Assemble your resulting object.
- Photograph it.
- Bring it to class on Thursday (10/10). 

Reminders:
- Use **red** lines for anywhere you want the laser to cut. 
- Use **blue** lines for anywhere you want it to etch.

# Submission
- Export your cut file as an SVG. 
- Add your images, screenshots, and photos of fabricated object to your digital sketchbook. 
- Submit your Rhino file and SVG file to Canvas, together with a pdf of the pages from your digital sketchbook documenting this project.
  - use the naming convention _ex2_Lastname.svg_ and _ex2_Lastname.3dm_ for the files.
- DUE by 9:30am, 10/10 (Thursday) to Canvas [https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/864451](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/864451)
