A 3D model of Kev's chihauhua Archie, from [Kevs Robots](https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/3d_papercraft.html)

# Description + Process

- Using a combination of 3d primitives and solid editing tools, design a paper-craft sculpture you want to fabricate. 
- Using the [week 3-1](../sessions/week3-1.md) and [week3-2](../sessions/week3-1.md) tools UnrollSrf, Explode, and your 2d drawing tools, flatten this object into a series of pieces that can be fashioned from cut paper. 
- Add paper tabs as necessary for assembly.
- Cut this design using the laser cutter and bring it, assembled, to class on Tuesday.
- **Simple is ok!** I want to you to gain experience with the workflow.
