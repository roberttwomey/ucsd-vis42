## Homework
Keep working on Project 1 (due Monday, 9/27)

## Material Testing Methods

- When you first work with a new material, you want to determine what settings work best for cutting and engraving. 
- As a starting point, you can begin with [the suggested settings for common materials](week2.html#power-settings).
- Typically you might produce a small shape (square, or text) which you can run multiple times with different settings for the 
- Full Spectrum Laser (who manufactures our laser) has some material test files we can try: [https://fslaser.com/material-test/](https://fslaser.com/material-test/)

### Cutting Acrylic

Acrylic is the most common plastic sheet good that we might cut with the laser cutter. 
- We can vector cut, vector engrave, or raster engrave acrylic very successfully.
- When you first get a new sheet of acrylic, determine what thickness it is (calipers): [measuring thickness](week2.html#measuring-thickness)
- Run some material tests to find speed, power, and current settings.
