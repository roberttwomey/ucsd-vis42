  - See the [MIT 2.007 Design and Manufacturing I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-007-design-and-manufacturing-i-spring-2009/) resource on [Design Handbook: Engineering Drawing and Sketching](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-007-design-and-manufacturing-i-spring-2009/pages/related-resources/drawing_and_sketching/)

### Walk through Dimensioning Example

In class demonstration with calipers and pen and paper/whiteboard.

## Dimensioning in Rhino
- Strategies for building a dimensioned model in Rhino.
- Creating curves, surfaces, with exact dimensions (using text entry)
- Creating a 2d sketch/reference drawing layer, separate from 3d layer.
- Keep your sketches so you can "re-generate" the solids with slightly adjusted sizes, if you need to.
- Adding actual "dimensions" to a rhino model (to produce engineering drawings)

## Homework
- Submit documentation for [Project 1 - Flat Pack Future](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60628/assignments/856576) (DUE tomorrow 11/1 end of day)
- **HW** [Exercise 6: Digital Double](exercises/ex6) (DUE Thursday 11/7) **design and Fabricate**
